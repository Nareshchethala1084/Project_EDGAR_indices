# Phase 2:
Additional to the pahse 1, we can do more on project with the use of *data visualization* and *statistical analysis.*
We can try to answer through visualizations and basis statistical analysis:
Time series counts of filings per year/quarter/month.\n
Is there a seasonality? For instance, are there more filings in a particular month?
Top N filers / Top N filing types
Summary statistics of filings over quarters/ months: min/max/mean/median/sd of filings
Are there correlations between certain types of filings?
Does the company name ever change for a given CIK? How often? How many instances do you notice?
We can try more with any questoins that might be answered.
